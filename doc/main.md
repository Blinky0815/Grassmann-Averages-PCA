Welcome to the "Grassmann averages for scalable robust PCA C++" library.

Content
-------
This library provides a mean to compute Principal component analysis in a robust manner, using Grassmann averages. The method scales particularly well
for high dimensional problems. The full details can be found in the following article 

> **Grassmann averages for Scalable Robust PCA**, SÃ¸ren Hauberg, Aasa Feragen and Michael J. Black
> Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014

or on the web page of [the Robust PCA](http://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/project/Robust_PCA).
